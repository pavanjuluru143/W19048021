Aim 
---------------------------------------------------
The main aim of this research is to investigate vulnerability using WPA2 and WPA3 password authentication scheme, perform attacks and check WPA3 is secure than WPA2, and  provide mitigation techniques to secure Wireless LAN

Executing steps
---------------------------------------------------
STEP-1: Capture Handshake
STEP-2: Upload and convert a WPA / WPA2 pcap capture file to a hashcat capture file
STEP-3: Use password intelligence using OSINT Framework
STEP-4: Perform attacks on handshake file for WPA2 and WPA3
STEP-5: Compare and analyze

Conclusion
---------------------------------------------------
Research provided accurate analysis on WPA2 and WPA3 password cracking techniques. Here WPA3 were not able to crack using attack that successfully cracked WPA2. Additionally research enhanced the password cracking process using OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) framework, GPU (Graphical Processing Unit) and HashCat tools. Investigation use Hashcat tool to perform Hybrid attack, combinatory attack, and dictionary attack on handshake file. It is efficient to perform attack for known password patters but kaggle password dataset and OSINT framework can help to increase probability. Research utilized sample list of the 1Lakh passwords and performed attack using various attack mode, mask, and rule used to perform actual password attack. 
OSINT is huge collection of the related information that improved password attack to increase probability of correct password. It is very important to have efficient password list (wordlist) and password intelligence for the security testing. OSINT framework provides crucial information for highest quality password and related information. Comparatively it is efficient and useful to gain an actual password within in short-time. Investigation improves security skills for network administrators and also makes them proficient for managing effective passwords (secrete key) in wireless networks. 
Network administrators must use strong authentication keys and WPA3 security mode to reduce the attacks. WEP is outdated and has many security issues as well as WPA/WAP2 has been proven as less secure but still this protocol is widely used in the world.  WPA3 is newer technology after WPA2, providing robust security where the client is accessing an open network rather than establishing connection between APs and client. In WPA3 attacker can capture and takeout handshake file but it is very hard to recover or gain actual network access key. WPA3 is designed to solve every security issue associated with the previous standards.
